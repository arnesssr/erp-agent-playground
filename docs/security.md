# Security Guidelines

This document provides security guidelines and best practices for the AI Agent Playground.

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

The AI Agent Playground uses a secure authentication system to verify user identity:

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is supported
- Session management with secure cookies and proper expiration

### API Authentication

API endpoints are secured using token-based authentication:

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with appropriate expiration
- API keys for service-to-service communication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Authorization

Access control is implemented using a role-based access control (RBAC) system:

- Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Developer, Viewer)
- Resources have associated permissions
- Access is granted or denied based on the user's role and the resource's permissions

## Data Security

### Sensitive Data Handling

Sensitive data such as API keys and credentials are handled securely:

- Encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
- Access to sensitive data is logged and audited

### Credential Management

User credentials and API keys are managed securely:

- Stored in a secure credential manager
- Never exposed in logs or error messages
- Rotated regularly

## Code Security

### Input Validation

All user input is validated to prevent injection attacks:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const userSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(3).max(50),
  email: z.string().email(),
  role: z.enum(['admin', 'developer', 'viewer']),
});

function createUser(userData: unknown) {
  const validatedData = userSchema.parse(userData);
  // Proceed with creating user using validated data
}
```

### Output Encoding

All output is properly encoded to prevent XSS attacks:

```typescript
import { encode } from 'html-entities';

function displayUserInput(input: string) {
  const encodedInput = encode(input);
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: encodedInput }} />;
}
```

### CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is implemented:

```typescript
import { csrf } from 'csrf-protection-library';

// Generate CSRF token
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const csrfToken = csrf.generateToken(req);
  res.locals.csrfToken = csrfToken;
  next();
});

// Validate CSRF token
app.post('/api/action', csrf.validateToken, (req, res) => {
  // Process action
});
```

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security

The AI Agent Playground infrastructure is secured using:

- Firewalls to restrict access to necessary ports and services
- VPNs for secure remote access
- Network segmentation to isolate sensitive components

### Container Security

Container security is ensured through:

- Regular scanning for vulnerabilities
- Minimal base images
- Principle of least privilege for container processes

### Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed securely:

- Regular updates to address security vulnerabilities
- Dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities
- Lockfiles to ensure consistent dependency versions

## Compliance

### Data Privacy

The AI Agent Playground complies with data privacy regulations:

- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data minimization principles

### Audit Logging

Audit logging is implemented for security-relevant events:

```typescript
import { logger } from './logger';

function auditLog(event: string, user: string, resource: string, action: string, success: boolean) {
  logger.info({
    event,
    user,
    resource,
    action,
    success,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}

// Usage
auditLog('authentication', 'user123', 'login', 'login', true);
```

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

Automated security testing is part of the CI/CD pipeline:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Dependency scanning

### Penetration Testing

Regular penetration testing is conducted to identify vulnerabilities:

- External penetration testing by third-party security firms
- Internal security assessments
- Bug bounty program

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan

A security incident response plan is in place:

1. Identification of security incidents
2. Containment to limit damage
3. Eradication of the threat
4. Recovery to normal operations
5. Lessons learned and improvements

### Reporting Security Issues

Users and developers can report security issues through:

- Dedicated security email: security@example.com
- Bug bounty program
- Responsible disclosure policy

## Conclusion

Security is a continuous process, not a one-time effort. The AI Agent Playground team is committed to maintaining and improving the security of the platform through regular reviews, updates, and adherence to security best practices.
