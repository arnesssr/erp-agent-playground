# Architecture

This section provides an overview of the architecture of the AI Agent Playground.

## High-Level Architecture

The AI Agent Playground is built using a modern web application architecture with React for the frontend and a modular approach to backend services. The application is designed to be extensible and maintainable.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript, with a component-based architecture. The main components are:

- **Agent Canvas**: Visual workflow designer
- **Code Editor**: Code editing interface
- **Simulation Panel**: Testing interface
- **Component Palette**: Library of components
- **Properties Panel**: Component configuration

### Backend Architecture

The backend is designed to be modular and extensible, with support for various language models and integrations. The main components are:

- **Model Management**: Framework for managing language models
- **Integration Framework**: Framework for connecting to external services
- **Agent Orchestration**: Framework for coordinating multiple agents

## Component Architecture

### Agent Canvas

The Agent Canvas is built using a custom implementation of a visual workflow designer. It includes components for nodes (representing agent components) and edges (representing connections between components).

### Code Editor

The Code Editor is built using a custom implementation of a code editor with syntax highlighting and other features. It supports multiple file types and languages.

### Simulation Panel

The Simulation Panel provides a way to test agents against mock data. It includes components for selecting mock data, running simulations, and viewing results.

## Data Flow

### Agent Creation

1. User creates a new agent or selects a template
2. User adds components to the canvas
3. User configures component properties
4. User writes custom code if needed
5. User tests the agent using the simulation panel
6. User deploys the agent

### Agent Execution

1. Agent is triggered by an event (e.g., new invoice)
2. Agent processes the event using the configured components
3. Agent interacts with external systems if needed
4. Agent completes the task and returns results

## Integration Architecture

The AI Agent Playground supports integration with various external services through the Integration Framework. Integrations are implemented as classes that extend the `Integration` abstract class and provide tools for agents to use.

## Model Architecture

The AI Agent Playground supports multiple language models through the Model Management framework. Models are registered with the `ModelManager` and can be used by agents.

## Deployment Architecture

The AI Agent Playground can be deployed in various environments:

- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Testing**: Testing environment for QA
- **Production**: Production environment for end users

The application is designed to be containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
